                <h3 class="yellow">Family:</h3>
                <p>The reproduction of this creature is quite unique. They cannot reproduce when they are alive as they don't have DNA or organ like creatures on earth
                    . Instead, when night comes, they will all be cracked into piece by meteorolites and embedded into the ground. When the horrible night ends, they will strive 
                    again. They are the only kind of creature on this red planet.

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>The red planet---Scarlet Expanse, is one thousand light year away from our home, which has extremely long rotation period due to 
                    its high mass and size. As consequence, you won't have as many "days and nights" as on earth. Each day and night on this planet is 
                    equivalent to one year on earth. Unlike the earth, where the ecosystems, weather and properties won't change much because of the turn of 
                    day and night, Scarlet Expanse will have very different properties between days and nights. On the daytime, the only kind of creature 
                    on this planet---worm tree, will flourish by absorbing energy and nutrition from the soil. As this planet don't have light pollution and industrial 
                    pollution like earth, the galaxy where it belong to---Andromeda, and its sun can be clearly seen from the ground. When the constant gentle breeze 
                    blow across the Crimson Sea, you can see the relection of the sunlight and the twilight of galaxy. However, the night is quite a different 
                    story. During the long night which will last another one earth year, due to some complicated physical law, tons of meteorolite will be pulled towards
                    the planet and rub with the thick atmosphere, finally falling apart and create an effect similar to the fireworks on earth. Unfornately, 
                    some of them with heavy mass will still crash the land and kill creatures. Thus, you will notice there're no creatures can survive at night.
                    However, the meteorolites, which contain rich minerals, largely feed the soil and ultimately provide nutrition for the growth of such creature
                    at daytime,which is one earth year later.

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>From a distance, you may mistake it for a tree. However, when you get close, you will find this kind of creatures don't have leaves and 
                looks more like coral and worm on earth. Don't be scared by its mysterious apperance, their only possible movement is swaying with the gentle 
                breeze on this planet, so you can even touch it by your hand without getting hurt. The harsh environment force them to form the ability to 
                absorb even the smallest source of energy, so their stems are deeply rooted under the ground and feed on the mineral substance from the 
                meteorolites</p>

                    <li>No motor ability.</li>
                    <li>Feed on the meteorolite remains.</li>
                    <li>Grow at day and die at night</li>
                    <li>Lots of coral-like branches</li>

                No human has ever stepped onto the red land of Scarlet Expanse, but there's a rover sent to this planet and it successfully took thousands of picture of 
                this unique creature. As the only kind of creature on this red planet, scientists had been wondering about their source of food for a long time. Only after 
                the arrival of night and thousands of meteorolites appearing at sky, which has been one year after the landing of the rover, scientists started to realize
                the precious value of meteorolites for supporting the life. What's more, by examining through the simple lab on the rover, they also found such creature 
                don't have DNA, cell and other strutures like lifes on earth. Although remained to be further studied, some scientists insist that their life activity is more
                similar to chemical reaction rather than biologial process, providing us a good instance of how lifes evolved in the early period of the earth.

                <span class="red">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> This is important!!! 1) There are day mode and night mode. Press 1 to switch to the 
                day mode and press 2 to switch to night 2).In day mode, you can click on the beach by your mouse to grow a Worm Tree. Only one can grow at a time, so please wait 
                until the tree stops growing, then click on somewhere else. 3) To ensure 3-D effect, please plant trees in such an order that first plant trees far from you and then 
                plant closer and closer to you, so that the trees that are far away from you will not cover the trees closer to you. 4)At night(press 2), you can click on the sky to 
                watch a meterolite explodes.
