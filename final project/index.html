  <h1>Food Dash</h1>

  <!-- the following div will contain the p5 canvas. -->
  <div id="canvasContainer"></div>

   <div> <h3 class="red">Objective:</h>
    <p class="black">Control a stray cat and help it collect safe food while avoiding cars. Be careful of the human food and the cars whizzing by! Also don't overfeed yourself.</p>
  </div>


   <div><h3 class="red">Controls:</h>
    <p class="black">Use "a,w,s,d" to move the cat.
      Press "1" on the keyboard to pick up and eat food beside you.</p></div>


   <div>
    <h3 class="red">Food:</h>
  <p class="black">The road has different types of food randomly scattered (all near your starting point).
    Some food is safe, while others are harmful.
    Safe food gives scores/restore HP, while harmful food or extremely low HP point lead to failure.</p>
   </div>



   <div>
    <h3 class="red">Overfeeding:</h>
  <p class="black">Be mindful of the cat's consumption.
    Overfeeding (HP>140) leads to losing the game.</p></div>


   <div> <h3 class="red">    Game Over:</h>
    <p class="black">The game ends if:</p>
    <p class="black">The cat is overfed/starved(HP>140orHP=0).</p>
    <p class="black">The cat eats harmful food.</p>
    <p class="black">The cat collides with a car.</p></div>


   <div><h3 class="red">Win the game:</h>
    <p class="black">If you eat all healthy food(9 in all), then you win!</p></div>
